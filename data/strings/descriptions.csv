perseanchronicles_dash,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly moves the ship first into an alternate dimension known as p2-space before dropping to p-space. The ship can still be detected by its phase coil emissions, but can not be hit by any weapons.  Subjective time passes rapidly for the ship and its crew while in p2-space. Subjective time in p-space is slower, but passes more quickly than in world-time.

The effect lasts only for a few world-time seconds.",Special,Dives into an accelerated-time dimension for a few world-time seconds. Ship can not be hit by any weapons.,,
wisp_perseanchronicles_vara,SHIP,"The smallest ship in the Telos navy punches far above its weight, but has a glass jaw and relies on avoiding damage rather than trading it. Peerless agility and the ability to dive into phase space for short intervals allow their pilots to react at the speed of thought, literally. As with the rest of the Telos lineup, the Vara is controlled telepathically using ""Ether"" nanites, though non-networked crew may works its slow manual controls in a pinch. Strong shielding absorbs lucky shots, but a Vara will fall quickly to sustained fire. The manual recommends relying on flanking and surgical strikes to cripple enemies, and avoiding strike craft at all costs.",,,,
